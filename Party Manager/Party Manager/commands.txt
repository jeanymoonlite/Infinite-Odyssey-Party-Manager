                                 Note: This command should also, like create char, inform users
                                 when they are giving a character a name that already exists.

  [] save : Saves the edits made to the character (it also actually modifies the character).

[] remove-char (name) : Removes a character with the given name. This command rejects any characters
                        that don't exist in the manager. Note: If the character that was removed,
                        was in a 1-person party, that party will be removed. The user should be informed
                        of this.

[x] create-party (name character...) : Creates a new party with the given name and characters.
                                      The character names MUST all be in one line, separated by commas.
                                      Invalid characters (as in characters that don't exist) will be
                                      ignored and will be informed to the user that that character
                                      didn't get added because they don't exist.
                                      Characters that are mentioned more than once, don't get added
                                      twice; instead the command, at the end, informs the user that
                                      that character was mentioned twice but was NOT added twice.
                                      Note: Parties with the same name, even if they have different

                               Note: This command should also, like create party, inform users when they
                               are giving a party a name that already exists.

  [] edit-name (newName): Changes the name of the party with the given one.

                         party is.
